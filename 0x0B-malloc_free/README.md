Introduction
Welcome to the 0x0B-malloc_free documentation on memory allocation and the malloc function. In many programming languages, including C, managing memory is a crucial aspect of writing efficient and reliable software. This README will provide an overview of memory allocation in C and offer guidance on using the malloc function for dynamic memory allocation.

Memory Allocation in C
In C, memory allocation can be categorized into two types:

Stack Allocation: Memory is allocated on the stack, and it is managed automatically by the compiler. It is typically used for local variables and has a limited lifespan.

Heap Allocation: Memory is allocated on the heap, and it must be managed explicitly by the programmer. This is where the malloc function comes into play.

Using malloc
The malloc function in C is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap. It stands for memory allocation. When using malloc, it is essential to understand its function signature:

malloc(size_t size): Allocates a block of memory of the specified size (in bytes) on the heap and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory.
malloc returns NULL if the allocation fails.

Best Practices
When working with malloc and dynamic memory allocation in C, it's essential to follow best practices to avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior. Some key practices include:

Always check the return value of malloc for NULL to handle allocation failures gracefully.
Make sure to free the allocated memory using the free function when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
Avoid casting the return value of malloc (e.g., int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));). It's unnecessary in C.
Be mindful of the size you request with malloc to avoid over-allocating memory.
Use the sizeof operator to calculate the correct size for the allocated memory, especially when dealing with arrays or structs.
