Introduction to Pointers
In the Introduction to Pointers section, you will learn what pointers are, how they work, and why they are crucial in C programming. We will cover topics such as:

Declaring and initializing pointers
Accessing the value pointed to by a pointer
Pointer arithmetic
Passing pointers to functions
Arrays in C
The Arrays in C section delves into the concept of arrays, which are collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Here, you will explore:

Declaring and initializing arrays
Accessing array elements
Multi-dimensional arrays
Arrays as function arguments
Dynamic memory allocation for arrays
Working with Strings
Strings in C are arrays of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. In the Working with Strings section, you'll discover:

Declaring and initializing strings
String manipulation functions
Character arrays vs. pointers for strings
Common string-related issues and how to avoid them
Examples
The Examples section contains practical examples to solidify your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings. Each example includes code snippets and explanations to demonstrate the concepts discussed earlier.
