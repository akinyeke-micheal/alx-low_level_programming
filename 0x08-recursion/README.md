# 0x08-recursion

This repository contains examples and explanations related to the concept of recursion in programming. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's an important topic in computer science and programming.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to recursion
- Base cases and recursive cases
- Writing recursive functions
- The stack in recursion
- Common pitfalls and infinite recursion
- Examples of problems solved using recursion

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x08-recursion.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```
   cd 0x08-recursion
   ```

3. Each `.c` file contains an example of a recursive function solving a specific problem. You can compile and run these files to see the recursion in action.

   Example:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-recursive_factorial.c -o factorial
   ./factorial
   ```

4. Explore and modify the code to understand how recursion works and experiment with different inputs.
