## Introduction
A double linked list is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of double linked lists through practical projects and examples.

## Features
The "Double Linked List Projects in C" repository offers the following features:

- **Implementation**: You will find a complete implementation of a double linked list in C, including functions for creating a list, inserting elements, deleting elements, searching, traversing, and more.

- **Operations**: The repository covers various operations that can be performed on double linked lists, such as appending, prepending, inserting at a specific position, deleting nodes, reversing the list, and sorting.

- **Memory Management**: The projects emphasize proper memory management in C, including dynamically allocating and deallocating memory for nodes and handling memory leaks.

- **Error Handling**: Error handling techniques are demonstrated to ensure robustness and graceful handling of exceptional situations, such as handling invalid inputs, out-of-memory scenarios, and empty lists.

## Projects
The "Double Linked List Projects in C" repository includes the following projects:

1. **Double Linked List Implementation**: This project provides a complete implementation of a double linked list in C. It covers all the basic operations and serves as the foundation for the subsequent projects.

2. **List Operations**: Here, you will find projects that focus on various operations and functionalities of double linked lists, including inserting elements, deleting nodes, searching for a value, counting elements, and more.

3. **Reversing the List**: This project delves into reversing a double linked list, exploring different approaches and algorithms to efficiently reverse the order of elements in the list.

4. **Sorting the List**: In this project, you will learn different sorting techniques and apply them to sort a double linked list. It covers algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, and more.

Feel free to explore each project's directory for more detailed information, code examples, and explanations of the algorithms used.
